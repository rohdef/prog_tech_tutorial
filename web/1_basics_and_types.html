        <h1>Getting started</h1>
        <p>As this tutorial (at least in this initial version) assumes some knowledge of
        programming/scripting.  It is also assumed that not much of it has been done, and
        it's likely that it was done in JavaScript, Python or similar. If you're used to
        types already it should be enough to read the setup part of this document.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h1>Basic setup</h1>
        <p>Java is - to put it blunt - a huge ass language.  Further more it's also the name
        of the virtual machine running it.  Hence it should not surprice that there's a lot
        to actually knowing Java.  A which point I will stress once more. Do <strong>not</strong>
        search the net for help.  It will be counter productive, as the focus is on
        techniques, but will also give answers that is too complicated.</p>
        
        <p>And not to the actual setup.  For our first parts we will need a template where
        we won't bother about what the code actually means, this is more a getting started
        template, a so called bootstrap:</p>
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/rohdef/89f9b0790129cce4dbad.js?file=Bootstrap.java"></script>
        
        
        <p>Well ok a little description is needed.  First off the name "Bootstrap" in the first
        line has to match the name of the .java-file, case sensitive (that is b and B are
        different).  Line 2 just has to be here, some of it will make more sense quite soon.</p>
        
        <p>On line 3 we start with //, which means that a comment starts.  This is a piece of
        text that is ignored, and it ends when the line ends.  These are useful for making
        notes inside the code and should be used to help gaining an overview.  You can add
        your code by adding new lines after this.  Make sure though to keep your code before
        the two last curley brackts }, that are currently on line 3 and 4.</p>
        
        <p>Let's get some code running.  This assumes that you have set up Java and are
        familiar with basic console/terminal/command prompt (I will use terminal from here on)
        navigation - other tutorials for this will be added or linked to later.  One of the
        reasons for doing it like this is to understand what an IDE (such as IntelliJ and
        Eclipse) actually does behind the scenes.</p>
        
        <p>Write the code from above into a file (make sure the class name on line 1 matches
        the file name), consensus is to start with an upper case name and although Java
        allows lower case it's frowened upon and considered very bad style.</p>
        
        <p>After the comment on line 3 (you can also delete the comment) add a new line, and
        add the following piece of code:</p>
        
        <pre class="code">
        System.out.println("Hello world!");</pre>
        
        <p>Now in the terminal type the following commands (change Bootstrap to your chosen
        name)</p>
        
        <pre class="commands">
        javac Bootstrap.java
        java Bootstrap</pre>
        
        <p>If everything is done right your console should print out: "Hello world!".  If
        not try to play around and see if you can get it to work.  If you get entirely stuck
        there's a hint with the expected code, but try not to it.</p>
        
        <tutorial-hint>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rohdef/89f9b0790129cce4dbad.js?file=BootstrapSolution.java"></script>
        </tutorial-hint>
        
        <p>Now that was awesome, right?  Well OK, I guess I have to agree; that is a very
        round about way to get a computer to write something, but it's the beginning of something
        more.  Now the code part is basically Java's command for Java to print something on the
        screen.</p>
        
        <p>The next two is two terminal commands, first one is "javac" which is Java's
        compile command, this basically translates the code you wrote into something the computer
        understands.  As you may already don't know how to just run what you wrote (not entirely
        true, there is interpreted languages) it has to translate it into something the machine
        understands - as Java is running on an VM there's technically more to it, but let's stick
        with the simplified explanation.  The compilers task is to translate your code, which is
        something between human readable and machine code.  What the compiler outputs is a .class-
        file corresponding to your file, this is your binary file - that is the one that can be run.</p>
        
        <p>Lastly we have the command "java" which tells Java to run what's specified after it. 
        That's basically it.  Congratulations, you just wrote your first Java program.  Now go
        ahead and do the following experiments (remember to do "javac" each time you change something,
        before running it):</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Change the content in System.out.println, make sure to put it inside the quotes. Can
          you make it print your name?</li>
          <li>Try to remove one of the quotes, read the error when you get.  What could it mean?</li>
          <li>Put the quote back there, and try to remove the semi colon at the end of the line. 
          What does the error from "javac" mean? (Tip, remember this error, you will see it a lot).</li>
          <li>Play around, put 3 prints in the code, try to provoke some errors from Java.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h1>Types</h1>
        
        <p>Now the last boring (sorry but we need them foundations first) part.  Good news is, if you
        are already used to static typed languages (eg. C, Pascal, C#) you can skip this part.  Bad
        news if you ain't we need to cover it.  So let's get it over with.</p>
        
        <p>Understanding types is important, even in dynamic typed languages.  A lot of people fight
        with things like JavaScript's coercion, and how languages behave, because they are not aware
        of the underlying type system.  In dynamic languages you can typically write something like:
        <span class="inline-code">var a = 42;</span> and <span class="inline-code">var a = '42';</span>
        without bothing that the first one is a number and the second one is a text.  Often this is
        a nice feature, but there's a backside to it.  If you are not aware what's going on it can
        lead to some strange errors.</p>
        
        <p>In Java we operate with the following primitive data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>byte</strong> a small integer of 8 bits (= 1 byte, surprise) that is
          values from -128 to 127.  These aren't used that often. <span class="inline-code">byte a = 42;</span></li>
          <li><strong>short</strong> a small posive integer of 16 bits, rarely used</li>
          <li><strong>int</strong> the normal integer type, it uses 32 bits.  This is the
          most common of the integer types. <span class="inline-code">int number = 5568421;</span></li>
          <li><strong>long</strong> a huge interger (64 bits) type used mostly for cases
          where int isn't enough, such as unix timestamps.</li>
          <li><strong>float</strong> is a small decimal point number, usually double is
          used today.</li>
          <li><strong>double</strong> a big decimal point number, the most common for
          decimal numbers today. <span class="inline-code">double d = 3.1415926535;</span></li>
          <li><strong>boolean</strong> represents true and false values, mostly used for
          conditionals (code that states if something do something). <span class="inline-code">bool b = true;</span></li>
          <li><strong>char</strong> a 16 bit unicode character. <span class="inline-code">char c = 'q';</span></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Also you have seen the non-primitive String, through a so called string literal, namely
        writing it between two quotes. A string can be defined like this: <span class="inline-code">
        String s = "hey";</span>.  Note both the upper case S, in contrast to the primitive types and
        that it uses double quotes ", unlike char that uses single quotes '.</p>
        
        <p>There's way more to types than written here.  This is intended to get us started.  Let's carry
        on an go to some fun and then play with conditionals and basic loops.</p>
