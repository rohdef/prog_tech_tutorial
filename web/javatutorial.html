    <h1>Programming techniques in Java - Tutorial</h1>
    
    <h2>Another Java tutorial?</h2>
    <p>This torial actually focus more on programming techniques than Java.
    The resoning behind this tutorial is not to learn Java as such, although
    it will have that fortunate side effect. Here the focus is on programming
    techniques.</p>
    
    <p>Java is chosen as the platform for multiple reasons:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Java is very strict, which makes it easier to do good code in less
      strict languages once good coding styles have been learned.</li>
      
      <li>Types, since a lot of languages is dynamic, most people forget about
      types.  Even those languages though use types and knowledge about them
      is definitely a help.</li>
      
      <li>As a C style language the syntax is very similar to most languages
      you'd meet.</li>
      
      <li>Java is a good choice for a future programming, as the platform is
      mature.</li>
      
      <li>Android development is done in Java (desired by one of the original
      students).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>More reasons could probably be found, but are really not necessary.</p>
    
    <h2>For the student</h2>
    
    <p>First a word of warning. This tutorial is designed to provide all you
    need.  Do <strong>not</strong> search for help, etc. on Google.  Do
    <strong>not</strong> use syntax, keywords etc. from other languages you
    may know, unless taught here. The tutorial is designed to teach you
    techniques more than Java.  If you use outside sources, odds are that
    it will be counter productive.  If techniques is not your goal, this will
    be the wrong tutorial for you.</p>
    
    <p>The intended way of using this tutorial is that I start from the basics,
    so no fancy GUI etc., sorry.  Please go with the flow, there's sanity behind
    the annoyance.  All the graphical focus is nice, yes I do like it, but it is
    disturbing for the underlying basics.  "You gotta learn how to walk before you
    can run." (said by Olivier Danvy a lot, my favorite teacher).</p>
    
    <p>Also almost every step is followed by a lot of assigments.  I will try to
    group them, so they mark a learning level.  Practice makes best, so please
    solve all from each group to the level where you can do it in your sleep. I
    know, I know, it's a pain, yes!  But trust me, you will be thankful for doing
    it.  Just like everyone else.  I will also try to provide hints, but try not
    to use them.</p>
    
    <p>Stuck? Feel like you're stupid? Or perhaps that if you were just a little
    bit smarter, then...? Well first off, fear not. It is normal:
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_anxiety">Wikipedia on
    mathematical anxiety</a>.  Do not fear, rest, get some sleep and try again. 
    Yes, I said rest :) Best advice ever, do no try to be clever when tired. 
    Go to sleep and try again with a clear mind.</p>
    
    <h3>A word on IDE (Integrated Development Environment)</h3>
    
    <p>Most sane people do real world development in an IDE, such as IntelliJ
    or Eclipse.  In an production situation these are definitely good choices,
    Emacs even better.</p>
    
    <p>As this tutorial focus on techniques, please refrain from the temptation
    to use such a tool (Emacs without auto completion tools is fine :) ), as they
    will help you too much.  For on Linux I recommend either Emacs, Vim, Kate or
    Gedit (last two is graphical) and on Windows Notepad++ will likely be good 
    (haven't tested it).</p>
    
    <p>If you use the VirtualBox image provided, things will be already prepared
    for you with a simple setup.  See preparation instructions.</p>
    
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>This is intended to teach you techniques as a primary goal.  Please go with
    the flow.  To get most benefit out of this, please follow these guidelines:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Do not search the net for help.</li>
      <li>Avoid using the hints if possible</li>
      <li>Don't panic! Get some rest, and don't try to learn when tired.</li>
      <li>Do not use knowledge about syntax and keywords from other programming,
      what you need will be provided for.</li>
      <li>Do not use overly helpful IDEs, learn the commands used and use a basic
      text editor</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Provided this you should get a  good and safe introduction to programming
    techniques and improve your skills rapidly (provided you don't already know
    them :p but even so, try to see if you really do, it may be educational).</p>
